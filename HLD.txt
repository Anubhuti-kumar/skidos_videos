High-Level Design (HLD) for Video on Demand Backend Microservice:

System Architecture:

The Video on Demand backend microservice will follow a microservices architecture pattern.
It will consist of multiple components that work together to provide the required functionalities.


The major components include:
Authentication Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
Video Service: Manages video content, streaming, encryption, and search functionality.
Database: Stores video metadata, user information, and session data.
CDN (Content Delivery Network): Delivers video content efficiently to end-users.
Video Transcoding Service: Performs adaptive bitrate streaming by transcoding videos into multiple quality levels.


Authentication and Authorization:
Users need to authenticate before accessing videos.
Use a secure authentication mechanism such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
The Authentication Service will verify user credentials, generate and validate tokens.
Tokens will be passed in API requests for authorization.


Video Storage and Encoding:
Store videos in a scalable and distributed storage system.
Use a file storage service or cloud-based storage solution.
Videos should be encoded into multiple bitrate versions (adaptive bitrate streaming).
Transcoding service will convert videos to various resolutions and bitrates for adaptive streaming.


Video Encryption:
Implement video encryption to protect content from unauthorized access.
Use encryption algorithms to secure video files at rest and during transmission.
Generate unique encryption keys for each video.


Video Metadata and Search:
Maintain a database to store video metadata, including title, description, duration, resolution, and encryption keys.
Implement a search feature to allow users to search for videos based on keywords, categories, or tags.
Utilize a search engine or database indexing for efficient search operations.


Content Delivery:
Utilize a CDN to efficiently deliver video content to end-users worldwide.
CDN caches videos at edge locations, reducing latency and improving streaming performance.
Implement video streaming protocols like HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).
